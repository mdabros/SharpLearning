=================

![Build status](https://machinelearning.visualstudio.com/sharplearning-github-build/_apis/build/status/SharpLearning-CI?branchName=master)

SharpLearning is an opensource machine learning library for C# .Net. 
The goal of SharpLearning is to provide .Net developers with easy access to machine learning algorithms and models.

Currently the main focus is supervised learning for classification and regression, 
while also providing the necesarry tools for optimizing and validating the trained models.

SharpLearning provides a simple high-level interface for machine learning algorithms.    
In SharpLearning a machine learning algorithm is refered to as a *Learner*, 
and a machine learning model is refered to as a *PredictorModel*. An example of usage can be seen below:

```c#
// Create a random forest learner for classification with 100 trees
var learner = new ClassificationRandomForestLearner(trees: 100);

// learn the model
var model = learner.Learn(observations, targets);

// use the model for predicting new observations
var predictions = model.Predict(testObservations);

// save the model for use with another application
model.Save(() => new StreamWriter("randomforest.xml"));
```

All machine learning algorithms and models implement the same interface for easy replacement.

Currently SharpLearning supports the following machine learning algorithms and models:

* DecisionTrees
* Adaboost (trees)
* GradientBoost (trees)
* RandomForest
* ExtraTrees
* NeuralNets (layers for fully connected and convolutional nets)
* Ensemble Learning

All the machine learning algorithms have sensible default hyperparameters for easy usage. 
However, several optimization methods are available for hyperparameter tuning:

* GridSearch
* RandomSearch
* ParticleSwarm
* GlobalizedBoundedNelderMead
* Hyperband
* BayesianOptimization
