 2. Add more examples to [SharpLearning.Examples](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning.Examples).
 3. Solve existing issues by forking SharpLearning and creating a pull request.

The procedure when contributing should follow the steps below:

 1. Add an issue.
    1. Start the contribution with adding an issue. 
    2. Before writing the issue, make sure a duplicate does not already exist.    
    3. The issue should contain a description of the bug or feature suggestion.
This provides documentation and makes it possible to discuss the issue before time is spent on creating a pull request.

When an issue has been approved by an author, it is time to fork SharpLearning and create a pull request.	

 2. Creating a pull request
	1. [Fork the SharpLearning repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
    2. Code your contribution in the fork just created.
    3. Create a pull request using the [github page](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). 
Pull requests are usually created against the master branch, unless the pull request is part of a larger feature branch.
    4. Please provide a description of your contribution in the pull request.
    5. Link the pull request to the issue descripting the bug or feature.

 3. Review and feedback
	1. When the pull request has been made, an author will review the changes, and provide feedback.
    2. Discuss or implement the suggestions from the review.
    3. When the pull request has been approved, and author will merge the changes to the master.
 
## Coding standard
SharpLearning follows the [microsoft C# coding conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)
relatively closely. In general, try to write code in similar style to what is already present in the existing files/projects.
